The [Walking Skeleton](https://wiki.c2.com/?WalkingSkeleton) is the minimum,
crappy implementation of an end-to-end system that has all of the pieces you
need.  The point is to get the end-to-end system working first, and only
*then* start improving the various pieces.  I can still remember [Jacob
Steinhardt](https://jsteinhardt.stat.berkeley.edu/) telling me about this
trick while I was a PhD student at Stanford, and it has stuck with me ever
sense.

In the era of LLM coding, it has never been easier to get the entire system
working.  By using the system, it becomes obvious what the next steps should
be.  Get to that point as soon as possible.  The LLM can't dogfood the code it
writes!
